# my_portfolio_2021
This is a compilation of what I did in 2021.

# Algorithm
- randomized / deterministic select in cpp

select nth element with randomized / deterministic select algorithm and check validation in O(n)
main.cpp is referenced from TAs.
How to compile / run
$ make run

# SystemProgramming
- linklab
- shelllab
- malloclab(88/100)

since skeleton codes are CSA:PP's properties and TAs also have fixed them, I will not upload them in public space.
please check my original codes and reports.

# SWPP
- 2.assn
- 3.assn
- 4.assn
- 5.assn

please refer to readme.md in each folder.
they are also written by TAs, if there are any related issues please contact me so that I can delete all related codes.
Also, llvm should be built before running these codes.

# AnimalCrossingWiki_release
https://github.com/ydoh2016/AnimalCrossingWiki_release

There are known issues:
- click doesn't work, it terminates the application. only scroll should work.
